# Stripe Webhook Functions

This directory contains the Stripe webhook implementation for the Zip iOS app, which handles payment events and updates order statuses in real-time.

## Overview

The webhook functions provide comprehensive order lifecycle management by:
- Processing Stripe payment events
- Updating order statuses in the database
- Managing delivery time estimates
- Handling disputes
- Logging all payment activities for analytics

## Supported Stripe Events

### Payment Intent Events
- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Payment completed successfully
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Payment failed
- `payment_intent.canceled` - Payment canceled
- `payment_intent.processing` - Payment being processed
- `payment_intent.requires_action` - Payment requires user action

### Charge Events
- `charge.succeeded` - Charge completed successfully
- `charge.failed` - Charge failed
- `charge.dispute.created` - Dispute created
- `charge.dispute.closed` - Dispute resolved

### Invoice Events
- `invoice.payment_succeeded` - Invoice payment completed
- `invoice.payment_failed` - Invoice payment failed

### Subscription Events
- `customer.subscription.deleted` - Subscription canceled

## Order Status Flow

```
pending ‚Üí in_queue ‚Üí in_progress ‚Üí delivered
    ‚Üì
cancelled (if payment fails/cancels)
    ‚Üì
disputed (if dispute created)
```

## Database Schema

The webhook functions work with the following database structure:

### Orders Table
- `id` - Unique order identifier
- `status` - Current order status
- `payment_intent_id` - Stripe payment intent ID
- `estimated_delivery_time` - Expected delivery time

### Order Status History Table
- Tracks all status changes with timestamps
- Includes reasons and metadata for each change

### Payment Events Table
- Logs all Stripe webhook events
- Links events to orders for tracking

## Environment Variables

Required environment variables:

```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_... # Your Stripe secret key
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... # Your webhook endpoint secret
SUPABASE_URL=https://... # Your Supabase project URL
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ... # Your Supabase service role key
```

## Local Development

### Prerequisites
1. Supabase CLI installed
2. Stripe account with webhook endpoint configured
3. Local Supabase instance running

### Setup
1. Start local Supabase:
   ```bash
   supabase start
   ```

2. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
   supabase secrets set STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   ```

3. Deploy the function:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook
   ```

### Testing Locally

#### Test with Stripe CLI
1. Install Stripe CLI
2. Forward webhooks to local endpoint:
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to localhost:54321/functions/v1/stripe-webhook
   ```

3. Trigger test events:
   ```bash
   stripe trigger payment_intent.succeeded
   stripe trigger payment_intent.payment_failed
   stripe trigger charge.succeeded
   ```

#### Test with cURL
```bash
curl -i --location --request POST 'http://127.0.0.1:54321/functions/v1/stripe-webhook' \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ANON_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "type": "payment_intent.succeeded",
    "data": {
      "object": {
        "id": "pi_test123",
        "metadata": {
          "order_id": "test-order-uuid"
        },
        "amount": 2000,
        "currency": "usd"
      }
    }
  }'
```

## Production Deployment

### Stripe Dashboard Setup
1. Go to Stripe Dashboard > Developers > Webhooks
2. Add endpoint: `https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook`
3. Select events to listen for:
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `payment_intent.canceled`
   - `charge.succeeded`
   - `charge.failed`
   
   - `charge.dispute.created`
   - `charge.dispute.closed`

### Supabase Deployment
1. Deploy function:
   ```bash
   supabase functions deploy stripe-webhook --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF
   ```

2. Set production secrets:
   ```bash
   supabase secrets set --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_...
   supabase secrets set --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_REF STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   ```

## Error Handling

The webhook implements comprehensive error handling:

### Signature Verification
- Validates Stripe webhook signatures
- Logs verification failures with debugging info
- Returns appropriate HTTP status codes

### Database Operations
- Graceful handling of database connection issues
- Detailed error logging for failed updates
- Continues processing other events if one fails

### Event Processing
- Individual event processing errors don't fail the entire webhook
- All errors are logged for debugging
- Webhook acknowledges receipt even if processing fails

## Monitoring and Logging

### Log Levels
- ‚úÖ Success operations
- ‚ùå Errors and failures
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings and edge cases
- üìä Analytics and tracking
- üîß Configuration and setup
- üîÑ Processing status

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Webhook delivery success rate
- Order status update success rate
- Processing time per event
- Error frequency by event type
- Database operation performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Webhook Signature Verification Fails
- Check `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is correct
- Ensure webhook endpoint URL matches Stripe dashboard
- Verify Stripe API version compatibility

#### Database Update Failures
- Check `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` has proper permissions
- Verify database schema matches expected structure
- Check RLS policies allow service role operations

#### Event Processing Errors
- Review logs for specific error messages
- Check order metadata contains required fields
- Verify Stripe event structure hasn't changed

### Debug Mode
Enable detailed logging by setting:
```bash
SUPABASE_FUNCTIONS_DEBUG=true
```

### Health Check
Test webhook health with:
```bash
curl -X GET 'https://your-project.supabase.co/functions/v1/stripe-webhook/health'
```

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- Webhook endpoint doesn't require JWT authentication
- Stripe signature verification ensures authenticity
- Service role key used for database operations

### Data Validation
- All input data validated before processing
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Amount validation prevents negative values

### Access Control
- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Users can only access their own orders
- Service role has necessary permissions for webhook operations

## Performance Optimization

### Database Operations
- Efficient indexing on frequently queried fields
- Batch operations where possible
- Connection pooling for database operations

### Event Processing
- Asynchronous processing of non-critical operations
- Efficient error handling to prevent blocking
- Logging optimized for production environments

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
- Real-time notifications via Supabase realtime
- Integration with delivery tracking systems
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Automated dispute resolution workflows

### Scalability Improvements
- Event queuing for high-volume scenarios
- Horizontal scaling of webhook processors
- Caching layer for frequently accessed data
